# 3D-Tortuosity-DigitalRock-withSkeletonize-Dijkstra
This repository provides a Python implementation for calculating 3D tortuosity in porous media using a combined approach of skeletonization and the Dijkstra algorithm. It is designed to optimize computational efficiency and accuracy by reducing irrelevant nodes through skeleton-based preprocessing.
